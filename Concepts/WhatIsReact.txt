What is React?
A JS library (not a framework) for building UI
The main distinction between a framework and a library is that a framework inverts program control. 
It informs the developer of what they require. 
A library, however, does not. 
Instead, a programmer calls the library when and where he needs it.

Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. 
Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways.

A library is like going to Ikea.
You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. 
You donâ€™t feel like making your own table from scratch. 
Ikea allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home.
You are in control.

A framework, on the other hand, is like building a model home. 
You have a set of blueprints and a few limited choices when it comes to architecture and design. 
Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. 
And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input.

REAT IS COMPONENT-BASED
Do not repeat yourself!
